		This web app uses Conway's Game of Life to generate random numbers. The Game of Life is a
		cellular automation that follows simple rules to create complex patterns. In this app, each cell
		represents a number, and their evolution over time generates a series of random numbers.

	to generate random numbers with some modified rules. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve based
	on specific rules, resulting in fascinating patterns and behaviors.

<p class="mb-4">
	To generate random numbers, you set a hexadecimal seed value which then is used to generate random
	numbers as cells evolve.

	Feel free to explore the app, customize the settings, and observe how the numbers evolve and
	change. Have fun! 🎉
